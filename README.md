# Robotics_project
 
This project is currently under development. I am currently attempting to create a robot car that can be driven using hand tracking. This system will use an ultraleap motion camera to control a virtual steering wheel and accelerator in a virtual environment. This virtual steering wheel and accelerator will send steering and acceleration data to the robot car for control.
